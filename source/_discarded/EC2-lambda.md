Look below. Looks nice rigth. Try to open your console.
``` javascript
console.log('FUCK YEAH'); // FUCK YEAH
```
In there you will see the function beeing executed and showed. 
This is super easy becouse you dont need to worry about how this code is executed. In this case i trust you browser, and thereby your computer to execute it. 

When devolping bigger programs or functions, you cannot count on someone else running your code. Therefore you have to think about server and infrastructure and stuff. 

Well until Lambda functions. These are a part of a bigger paradigm. Try to google serverless and micro services structure.

Int short it allows you to run bigger functions without thinking about how they are executed. 

``` javascript
console.log('FUCK YEAH'); // FUCK YEAH
```

<script>
  console.log('HII');
</script>
