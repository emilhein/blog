#### Serverless
This framework makes it extremely simple to handle your lambda functions and provide them with a public api gateway endpoint. As i write most my lambda functions in node.js my examples will also be node.js.
You can read my post about specific lambda functions [here](link to post)

In this most i will mostly focus on the serverless framework.
